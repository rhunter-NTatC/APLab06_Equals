Lab: Overriding Equals and toString

You will be creating 4 classes.
  - 3 classes will be blueprints objects of your choosing.
  - 1 will be a runner
  
The 3 classes
  These will be blueprints for whatever object
  you want.  At a minimum the must have the following.
  
  - 3 parameters
  - 1 constructor
  - getter and setter methods for all parameters
  - override toString()
  - override equals()
  
  You may use whatever criteria you like to determine
  if two instances are equal.  But it should be reasonable.
  

The Runner
  This will illustrate if your equals() work as intended.
  It should have the following.
  
  - 4 separate instances of each class
  	at least 2 should have the same parameters
  	at least 1 should have different parameters
  - 3 tests for each set of instances
  	at least 1 should properly indicate the instances are equal
  	at least 1 should properly indicate the instances are not equal
  	
  	In total, this comes to:
  	12 instances (minimum)
  	9 tests (minimum)
